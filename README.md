Overview

Online multiplayer game with real time interaction

- Multiple phases of development
  - Prototyped: Native JS, backend uses ExpressJS
  - Stage 2- refactor to use React or more popular framework for frontend
  - Stage 3- refactor backend to use a Java or Python framework
  - 4- Consider trying Go?
- The system should be designed so the changes to front/back end aren't too crazy
- Project should make use of interfaces, complex OOP principles, and software design patterns

- Consider using C++ for a portion of this
